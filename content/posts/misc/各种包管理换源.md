> 众所周知的原因，最好换一下`apt`，`yarn`，`pip`的源，不然就挂VPN。这里总结一下

## apt

修改`/etc/apt/sources.list`即可，这里放上`Ubuntu16`的阿里云源

```
# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 16.04.7 LTS _Xenial Xerus_ - Release amd64 (20200810)]/ xenial main restricted

#deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 16.04.7 LTS _Xenial Xerus_ - Release amd64 (20200810)]/ xenial main restricted

# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to
# newer versions of the distribution.
deb http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted
# deb-src http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted

## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the
## distribution.

## Uncomment the following two lines to add software from Canonical's
## 'partner' repository.
## This software is not part of Ubuntu, but is offered by Canonical and the
## respective vendors as a service to Ubuntu users.
# deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu xenial partner
# deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu xenial partner

deb http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu xenial-security main restricted
# deb-src http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu xenial-security main restricted
deb http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu xenial-security universe
# deb-src http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu xenial-security universe
deb http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu xenial-security multiverse
# deb-src http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu xenial-security multiverse
```

注意标准的换法就是，只把源的地址换了，保留发行版的版本库（这里`xenial`就对应`Ubuntu16`），某些旧版的`Unbuntu`必须换上旧的源才行

## pip

```sh
# 临时
pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple package_name
# 永久
pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

或者直接改对应的配置文件`pip.ini`或者`.pip`（`pip config list -v`列出所有配置文件位置）

```ini
[global]
timeout = 6000
index-url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/ 
trusted-host = pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn
```

## yarn

```sh
# 查看当前源
yarn config get registry
# 换为淘宝的源
yarn config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org/
# 换为yarn官方源
yarn config set registry https://registry.yarnpkg.com
```
